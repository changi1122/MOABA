# MOABA

**MOABA** is Meeting support and Place recommendation Platform. The motivation behind creating this service arose from the inconvenience experienced during various events conducted by clubs or departments, where repetitive voting and selecting suitable venues for the number of participants posed difficulties. By utilizing this service, you can create, share, and aggregate survey results through a single link, as well as find venues that accommodate the number of attendees.

With MOABA, organizing meetings and events becomes a breeze. Say goodbye to the hassle of manually conducting polls and struggling to find the perfect location. Our platform streamlines the entire process, allowing you to focus on what matters most: productive and enjoyable gatherings.
